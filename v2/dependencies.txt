## -dev and -bin package dependencies
# 
# The following system dependencies are required for some specific R packages.
# However, the documented dependency is the a -dev or -bin package version.
#
# This is due to a quirk of some Debian packaging practices that means some
# work is needed. A not uncommon pattern in apt land is to include the major
# version in the package name, rather than the package version. This is
# typically done to support migration between major versions within a single OS
# lifetime. Because the CRAN system dependencies do not know what the major
# version and thus the name you will have on your OS is, they typically include
# the `-dev` or `-bin` version of the package, which acts like a meta package and will
# pull in the correctly named default major version for the OS. However, it
# frequently pulls in many more packages than the actual library needed. 
#
# So, to avoid pulling in more that we need, we figure out the actual name of
# the package, including major version, and depend on just that. Figuring this
# out is manual, but the following can help, from the target Ubuntu version:
#
# debtree $PACKAGE | dot -Tjpg | display
#
# There is usually a package in the form of $PACKAGEVERSION in the tree which is the
# one we actually need. This will need doing once for every version of base Ubuntu
# image we use for an R version.
