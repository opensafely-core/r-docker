title: "Package Versions for `Sys.getenv('MAJOR_VERSION')`"
output: github_document
---

This r: `r Sys.getenv('MAJOR_VERSION')` OpenSAFELY image is based on Ubuntu `r Sys.getenv('BASE')` with R `r getRversion()`.

## R packages

The image comes pre-installed with a set of R packages.
Note that some packages may no longer be on CRAN and so their URL below will link to the archive of that package's source code.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
pkgs <- read.csv("../packages.csv", header = TRUE)
pkgs$Url <- paste0("<https://cran.r-project.org/package=", pkgs$Package, ">")
knitr::kable(pkgs, caption = "A table of the R packages included in the image.")
```
